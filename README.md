#Student Movement Simulation

By Marshall Turner - Schacht Aslani Architects

Our immediate goal is to use real data from the College, including student schedules, to visualize student movement around campus. We want to identify the popular corridors and the most-utilized buildings on campus, determine how parking lots get used at different times of the day, and visualize how students adapt to building reconfiguration.
