#To-Do List

##High Priority
-	Graph building utilization
-	Completely comment code
-	Make table parsing more adaptive to other excel formats
-	Write more efficient goToClass routine in the Student class

##Standard Priority
-	Add path finding with A*
-	Make sure students arrive to campus with enough time to park
-	Restructure image layering (PGraphics buffer?)
-	Remove hard-coded values for building locations and class times.
-	Make tool to parse College's data into a format we can use, so we can quickly visualize other dates.
-	Document what it'll take to get this set up for another campus.

##Low Priority
-	Add controls for student clustering (after path finding is implemented)
