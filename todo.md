#To-Do List

##High Priority
-	Completely comment code.

##Standard Priority
-	Separate frameCount and time clock. Is there a better way to do this? How can we scrub through the day? Export to a movie seems easy.
-	Graph building utilization
-	Make table parsing more adaptive to other excel formats
-	Write more efficient goToClass routine in the Student class
-	Add path finding with A*
-	Make sure students arrive to campus with enough time to park
-	Restructure image layering (PGraphics buffer?)
-	Remove hard-coded values for building locations and class times. Use separate tables instead.
-	Make tool to parse College's data into a format we can use, so we can quickly visualize other dates.
-	Document what it'll take to get this set up for another campus. (LCC, Skagit)

##Low Priority
-	Add controls for student clustering (after path finding is implemented)
-	Flocking? Not sure what it'd get us, but nice to see.
